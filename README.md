# MNIST_prediction
A projects that implements a model from cmput 340 and a convolutional neural network

IN CONTEXT OF CMPUT 340 F2020
  In Lab 5 we will implement a small neural network, trained with gradient descent, to classify handwritten digits. You can expand our work in Lab 5 to use more    complex network structures to improve
classification accuracy. Convolution layers will substantially improve accuracy.2
